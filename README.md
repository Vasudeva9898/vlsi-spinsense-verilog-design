# vlsi-spinsense-verilog-design
SpinSense is a real-time motor speed monitoring system developed using the EDGE Artix 7 FPGA, a Hall effect sensor, a DC motor, and a buzzer. This project demonstrates how to interface a magnetic sensor with an FPGA to calculate and monitor the RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) of a rotating motor shaft on seven segment display
